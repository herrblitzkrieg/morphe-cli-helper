# morphe cli helper
Helper for using Morphe CLI on Windows 11.

 
Make sure you have installed the lastest Azul Zulu JRE from here: https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jre#zulu

Then download morphe.cmd and put it in a folder named ex. Morphe. Rest will be downloaded automatically by the cmd. Tip: drag and drop an apk/apkm directly into the window to immediately start patching. Use numbers 1-3 to select actions also works.
